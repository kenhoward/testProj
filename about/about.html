			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>I have the most amazing job and I am always amazed I get paid to have so much fun. I have been in the beauty industry since 2004 and there has not been a dull day since. I work behind the chair 4 days a week, on photo shoot sets any chance I get, educate for Wella, and get to take care of many brides. I am also a wife and a mother, which is another amazing job.

			<p>I am very passionate about what I do and would love to share that with you, which is why I created this site. If you ever want to chat about the art of beauty, I am always excited to.

			<h2>About My Career</h2>

				<p>I attended Paul Mitchell the School in Provo, UT 2004-2005.After school I went back to my hometown of Las Vegas and worked at a high end salon assisting multiple top stylists for an additional year of learning.
				</p>

				<p>A pair of brown eyes swept me back to Provo, where I worked at Metropolitan Salon for 6 years. There, I developed my own personal style and built incredible friendships. During this time I also studied business at UVU, instructed at American Beauty Academy, and had some babies.
				</p>

				<p>I am currently working on the next chapter in my life in Salt Lake City â€‹at the incredible Got Beauty, as well as beginning my career with the Wella Professionals family. Everyday I find new sources of inspiration and things to learn, which only fuels the flame to my passion.
